    <h2>How the App Works: </h2>
    
    <p>Upon opening the Qibla iFinder App the user is presented with the "Please Enable Location Services" request prompt. The "Allow Location Services" 
    button enables the app to use Location Services to direct you towards the Kaaba. After pressing the "Allow Location Services" the user
    is presented with 3 options: "Allow Once", "Allow While Using App", "Don't Allow". </p>
    <p> Please Select "Allow While Using App" For An Optimal User Experince</p>
    
    <h2>The "Allow Once" Option</h2>
    
    <p>By selecting the "Allow Once" option, Qibla iFinder will present the Qibla angle. Upon closing the app, "Please Enable Location Services" 
        will once again be prompted.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The "Allow While Using App" Option</h2>
    
    <p>Once selecting the "Allow While Using App" option, the user will be pointed towards the Kaaba. The user will Not be prompted again. This option is recommended for optimal user experience.</p>
    
    <h2>The "Don't Allow" Option</h2>
